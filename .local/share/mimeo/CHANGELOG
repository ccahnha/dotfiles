* Parse MIME-type from filepaths when managing associations.
* Parse qualified MIME-types (tree, suffix, parameters) and default to unqualified associations if no qualified associations are found.

# 2016-01-25
* Fixed bug with double commands with custom associations.
* Fixed localhost URL resolution.
* Fixed bug that let to empty output with `--desk2field` when omitting ".desktop" extensions.
* Add more debugging messages for reading and writing files.

# 2016-01-21
* Catch permission errors.

# 2016-01-20
* Ensure a single command per argument.
* Remove sorting of some informational output to ensure that the displayed order corresponds to the programmatic order, e.g. list MIME-types in the order that they are used to determine a matching desktop entry.
* Add `--show-all` option to print multiple commands for each argument.
* Fixed problem with ordering of multiple defaults.
* Display only one result per argument for most queries when not using `--show-all`.
* Percent-decode paths in file URLs when invoking commands.
* Better handling and passing of common function parameters.
* Renamed `--fullpath` to `--full-path`.
* Removed `--field2desk`. Use `--desk2field` with `--swap` instead.

# 2016-01-18
* Added `--filepath-help`.
* Fix handling of iterators in `modify_associations`.
* Omit isolated "%f" and "%u" when interpolating commands with no arguments to avoid empty arguments in returned command.


# 2016-01-15
* Refactored code to reduce duplication and heterogeneity.
* Added multiple options for querying information (`--desk2field`, `--field2desk`, `--fullpath`).

# 2016-01-14
* Fixed command bug from previous update.
* Added default arguments file support.
* Formatted desktop command-line arguments to avoid extra typing when the intention is unequivocal. The desktop extension may be omitted, and full paths may be passed.
* Updated Mimeman help message.
* Added `--finddesk` option to query paths to desktop files.

# 2016-01-13
* Added fallback switching between content and name detection for paths.
* Minor conversions to generalize functions.
* Allowed MIME-type matchers as arguments with --mimetype.
* Fixed bug in configuration file detection.
* Added `--desk2mime` and `--mime2desk`.


# 2016-01-13
* Completely rewritten in Python 3.
* Updated to conform to the latest versions of the standards on freedesktop.org[^see `Mimeo.py` for details]. The latest version has deprecated `$XDG_DATA_DIR/applications` (`~/.local/share/applications`) and all files in it. Use the `--deprecated` flag to continue to use these, including custom desktop files created by Mimeo.
* Several new options.
* Dropped support for `--purge` option.
* Redundant informational output formats have been simplified. Lines previously containing `foo.desktop /path/to/foo.desktop` now only contain `/path/to/foo.desktop`.

# 2015-06-23
* Added "--by-content" option.

# 2015-01-15
* Import defaults from `defaults.list` to `mimeapps.list` when updating `mimeapps.list`.

# 2011-04-25
* Added "--quiet" option to suppress output when running applications.


# 2011-03-12
* Loading of desktop files in subdirectories & further standard-compliance.
* URI handling via "x-scheme-handle/*" MIME-types.
* Special handling of 'file' URIs.
* New output format for some operations.

# 2011-02-22
Mimeo subsumed Mimeman's functionality, with needed corrections. Mimeman was a dirty kludge created without any knowledge of the standard. Mimeo is now able to manage MIME-type associations and create desktop files.

Mimeo's algorithm for determing associations has also been corrected in several places.
